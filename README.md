**DanceMotion Designer** is a software tool developed as part of a 4-DOF SCARA arm project. It assists users in creating motion planning for the robot and acts as a digital twin, providing a virtual representation of the robot's movements.  

This project utilizes the **URDF Importer** from Unity Technologies:
